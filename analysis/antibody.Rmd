Notes based on the study: [Development of a humanized monoclonal antibody
(MEDI-493) with potent in vitro and in vivo activity against respiratory
syncytial virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9359721/).

This study describes the generation of a humanised monoclonal antibody,
MEDI-493, that recognises a conserved neutralising epitope on the F
glycoprotein of RSV. Broad neutralisation of a panel of 57 clinical isolates of
the RSV A and B subtypes was demonstrated.

## Antibody sequence

Design of humanised VL and VH segments based on murine monoclonal antibody
1129. Human framework regions were derived from K102 for VL. VH framework (FR1)
region was derived from Cor; remaining framework regions were derived from CE-1
sequence.

## Basics

Notes from [Analysing antibody sequence for recombinant antibody
expression](https://www.genscript.com/gsfiles/techfiles/Analyzing_antibody_sequence_for_recombinant_antibody_expression.pdf).

* An antibody (a.k.a. immunoglobulin) is a large Y-shaped protein produced by B
  cells. They are used by the immune system to neutralise foreign objects.
* Fab region determines its antigen specificity (Fv region and CDR).
* Fc region determines the effects.

![](assets/igg.png)

* Each antibody (Ab) only binds to a specific antigen (Ag).
* Ab and Ag interact by spatial complementarity.
* Ab-Ag interaction are based on weak and non-covalent binding between Ab and
  Ag:
    * Electrostatic interactions
    * Hydrogen bonds
    * Van der Waals forces
    * Hydrophobic interactions
* The hinge region allows better binding.
* Ab-Ag binding is reversible.

![](assets/ab_ag.png)

* Ab binding residues are mainly located in Complementarity Determining Regions
  (CDRs)
* 6 CDRs form the combining site: L1, L2, L3, H1, H2, and H3
* CDR-H3 and L3 have a distinctive role in antigen recognition.

![](assets/ab_cdr.png)

The [framework region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_region) is a
subdivision of the variable region (Fab) of the antibody. The variable region is
composed of seven amino acid regions, four of which are framework regions
(FR1-4) and three of which are hypervariable regions. The framework region makes
up about 85% of the variable region. Located on the tips of the Y-shaped
molecule, the framework regions are responsible for acting as a scaffold for the
complementarity determining regions (CDR), also referred to as hypervariable
regions, of the Fab. These CDRs are in direct contact with the antigen and are
involved in binding antigen, while the framework regions support the binding of
the CDR to the antigen and aid in maintaining the overall structure of the four
variable domains on the antibody.

### Identifying CDRs by sequence

CDR-L1

* Start - approximately residue 24
* Residue before - **always** a Cys
* Residue after - **always** a Trp. Typically Trp-Tyr-Gln, but also Trp-Leu-Gln, Trp-Phe-Gln, Trp-Tyr-Leu
* Length - 10 to 17 residues

CDR-L2

* Start - **always** 16 residues after the end of L1
* Residue before - generally Ile-Tyr, but also, Val-Tyr, Ile-Lys, Ile-Phe
* Length - **always** 7 residues (except NEW [7FAB], which has a deletion in this region.)

CDR-L3

* Start - **always** 33 residues after end of L2 (except NEW [7FAB], which has the deletion at the end of CDR-L2)
* Residue before - **always** Cys
* Residue after - **always** Phe-Gly-XXX-Gly
* Length - 7 to 11 residues

CDR-H1

* Start - approximately residue 26 (**always** 4 after a Cys)
* Residue before - **always** Cys-XXX-XXX-XXX
* Residue after - **always** a Trp. Typically Trp-Val, but also, Trp-Ile, Trp-Ala
* Length - 10 to 12 residues

CDR-H2

* Start - **always** 15 residues after the end of Kabat / AbM definition of CDR-H1
* Residue before - typically Leu-Glu-Trp-Ile-Gly, but a number of variations
* Residue after - Lys/Arg-Leu/Ile/Val/Phe/Thr/Ala-Thr/Ser/Ile/Ala
* Length - Kabat definition 16 to 19 residues

CDR-H3

* Start - **always** 33 residues after end of CHR-H2 (**always** 2 after a Cys)
* Residue before - **always** Cys-XXX-XXX (typically Cys-Ala-Arg)
* Residue after - **always** Trp-Gly-XXX-Gly
* Length - 3 to 25 residues

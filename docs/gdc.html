Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-gdc">About the GDC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Genomic Data Commons (GDC) is
a data sharing platform that promotes precision medicine in oncology. It
is not just a database or a tool; it is an expandable knowledge network
supporting the import and standardisation of genomic and clinical data
from cancer research programs. The GDC contains NCI-generated data from
some of the largest and most comprehensive cancer genomic datasets,
including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Therapeutically Applicable
Research to Generate Effective Therapies (TARGET). For the first time,
these datasets have been harmonised using a common set of bioinformatics
pipelines, so that the data can be directly compared. As a growing
knowledge system for cancer, the GDC also enables researchers to submit
data, and harmonises these data for import into the GDC. As more
researchers add clinical and genomic data to the GDC, it will become an
even more powerful tool for making discoveries about the molecular basis
of cancer that may lead to better care for patients.</p>

<p>The following code builds a <code>manifest</code> that can be used to
guide the download of raw data. Here, filtering finds open gene
expression files quantified as raw counts using STAR from TCGA ovarian
cancer patients.</p>

href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga">The
Cancer Genome Atlas</a> (TCGA), a landmark cancer genomics program,
molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal
samples spanning 33 cancer types. This joint effort between NCI and the
National Human Genome Research Institute began in 2006, bringing
together researchers from diverse disciplines and multiple
institutions.</p>
<div id="tcga-nomenclature" class="section level3">
<h3>TCGA nomenclature</h3>
<p>Data from TCGA (gene expression, copy number variation, clinical
information, etc.) are available via the Genomic Data Commons (GDC).
Primary sequence data (stored in BAM files) are under controlled
accession and data access should be requested via <a
href="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login">dbGaP</a>
and should be done by the PI.</p>
